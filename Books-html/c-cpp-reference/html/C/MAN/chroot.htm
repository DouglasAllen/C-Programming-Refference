</h3>

<h3>NAME
</h3>       chroot - change root directory

<h3>SYNOPSIS
</h3>       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int chroot(const char *path);

<h3>DESCRIPTION
</h3>       chroot  changes  the  root  directory to that specified in
       path.  This directory will be used for path name beginning
       with  /.   The root directory is inherited by all children
       of the current process.

       Only the super-user may change the root directory.

<h3>RETURN VALUE
</h3>       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1  is  returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.

<h3>ERRORS
</h3>       Depending   on  the  file  system,  other  errors  can  be
       returned.  The more general errors are listed below:


       EPERM   The effective UID does not match the owner of  the
               file,  and is not zero; or the owner or group were
               specified incorrectly.

       EROFS   The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       EFAULT  path points outside your accessible address space.

       ENAMETOOLONG
               path is too long.

       ENOENT  The file does not exist.

       ENOMEM  Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EACCES  Search  permission is denied on a component of the
               path prefix.

       ELOOP   path contains a circular reference  (i.e.,  via  a
               symbolic link)

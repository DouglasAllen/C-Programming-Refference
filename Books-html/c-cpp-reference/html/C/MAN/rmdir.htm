<h3>NAME
</h3>       rmdir - delete a directory

<h3>SYNOPSIS
</h3>       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int rmdir(const char *pathname);

<h3>DESCRIPTION
</h3>       rmdir deletes a directory, which must be empty.

<h3>RETURN VALUE
</h3>       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.

<h3>ERRORS
</h3>       EPERM   The filesystem containing pathname does  not  sup-
               port the removal of directories.

       EFAULT  pathname  points  outside  your accessible address
               space.

       EACCES  Write access to the directory containing  pathname
               was  not  allowed for the process's effective uid,
               or one of the  directories  in  pathname  did  not
               allow search (execute) permission.

       EPERM   The  directory containing pathname has the sticky-
               bit (S_ISVTX) set and the process's effective  uid
               is  neither  the uid of the file to be deleted nor
               that of the directory containing it.

       ENAMETOOLONG
               pathname was too long.

       ENOENT  A directory component in pathname does  not  exist
               or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOTDIR pathname,  or  a  component used as a directory in
               pathname, is not, in fact, a directory.

       ENOTEMPTY
               pathname contains entries other than . and .. .

       EBUSY   pathname is the current working directory or  root
               directory of some process.

       ENOMEM  Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       EROFS   pathname  refers to a file on a read-only filesys-
               tem.

       ELOOP   pathname contains a reference to a  circular  sym-
               bolic  link,  ie  a  symbolic  link  containing  a

       unexpected  disappearance  of  directories which are still
       being used.

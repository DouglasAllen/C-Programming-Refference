<h3>READDIR(2)          Linux Programmer's Manual          READDIR(2)
</h3>

<h3>NAME
</h3>       readdir - read directory entry

<h3>SYNOPSIS
</h3>       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
       #include &lt;linux/dirent.h&gt;
       #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;

       _syscall3(int, readdir, uint, fd, struct dirent *, dirp, uint, count);

       int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct dirent *dirp, unsigned int count);

<h3>DESCRIPTION
</h3>       This  is  not the function you are interested in.  Look at
       readdir(3) for the POSIX conforming C  library  interface.
       This page documents the bare kernel system call interface,
       which can change, and which is superseded by  getdents(2).

       readdir  reads  one  dirent  structure  from the directory
       pointed at by fd into the memory area pointed to by  dirp.
       The  parameter count is ignored; at most one dirent struc-
       ture is read.

       The dirent structure is declared as follows:

              struct dirent
              {
                  long d_ino;                 /* inode number */
                  off_t d_off;                /* offset to this dirent */
                  unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this d_name */
                  char d_name [NAME_MAX+1];   /* file name (null-terminated) */
              }

       d_ino is an inode number.  d_off is the distance from  the
       start  of  the  directory to this dirent.  d_reclen is the
       size of d_name, not counting the null terminator.   d_name
       is a null-terminated file name.


<h3>RETURN VALUE
</h3>       On  success,  1  is  returned.   On end of directory, 0 is
       returned.  On error, -1 is  returned,  and  errno  is  set
       appropriately.

<h3>ERRORS
</h3>       EBADF  Invalid file descriptor fd.

       ENOTDIR
              File descriptor does not refer to a directory.

<h3>CONFORMING TO
</h3>       This system call is Linux specific.

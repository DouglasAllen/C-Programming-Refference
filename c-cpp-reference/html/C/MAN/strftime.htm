</h3>

<h3>NAME
</h3>       strftime - format date and time

<h3>SYNOPSIS
</h3>       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       size_t strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *format,
                           const struct tm *tm);

<h3>DESCRIPTION
</h3>       The  strftime()  function  formats the broken-down time tm
       according to the format specification  format  and  places
       the result in the character array s of size max.

       Ordinary characters placed in the format string are copied
       to s without conversion.  Conversion specifiers are intro-
       duced  by  a  `%' character, and are replaced in s as fol-
       lows:

       %a     The abbreviated weekday name according to the  cur-
              rent locale.

       %A     The  full  weekday  name  according  to the current
              locale.

       %b     The abbreviated month name according to the current
              locale.

       %B     The  full  month  name  according  to  the  current
              locale.

       %c     The preferred date and time representation for  the
              current locale.

       %d     The  day  of the month as a decimal number (range 0
              to 31).

       %H     The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour  clock
              (range 00 to 23).

       %I     The  hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock
              (range 01 to 12).

       %j     The day of the year as a decimal number (range  001
              to 366).

       %m     The month as a decimal number (range 10 to 12).

       %M     The minute as a decimal number.

       %p     Either  `am'  or  `pm'  according to the given time
              value, or the corresponding strings for the current
              locale.

              day of the first week.

       %w     The day of the week as a decimal, Sunday being 0.

       %x     The  preferred  date representation for the current
              locale without the time.

       %X     The preferred time representation for  the  current
              locale without the date.

       %y     The  year  as  a  decimal  number without a century

       %Z     The time zone or name or abbreviation.

       %%     A literal `%' character.

       The  broken-down  time structure tm is defined in &lt;time.h&gt;
       as follows:

              struct tm
              {
                      int     tm_sec;         /* seconds */
                      int     tm_min;         /* minutes */
                      int     tm_hour;        /* hours */
                      int     tm_mday;        /* day of the month */
                      int     tm_mon;         /* month */
                      int     tm_year;        /* year */
                      int     tm_wday;        /* day of the week */
                      int     tm_yday;        /* day in the year */
                      int     tm_isdst;       /* daylight saving time */
              };

       The members of the tm structure are:

       tm_sec The number of seconds after the minute, normally in
              the range 0 to 59, but can be up to 61 to allow for
              leap seconds.

       tm_min The number of minutes after the hour, in the  range
              0 to 59.

       tm_hour
              The  number  of hours past midnight, in the range 0

              to 23.

       tm_mday
              The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.

       tm_mon The number of months since January, in the range  0
              to 11.

       tm_year
              The number of years since 1900.

       tm_wday
              The  number of days since Sunday, in the range 0 to
              6.

       tm_yday
              The number of days since January 1, in the range  0
              to 365.

       tm_isdst
              A  flag that indicates whether daylight saving time
              is in effect at the time described.  The  value  is
              positive if daylight saving time is in effect, zero
              if it is not, and negative if  the  information  is
              not available.

<h3>RETURN VALUE
</h3>       The  strftime()  function returns the number of characters
       placed in the array s, not including the terminating  NULL
       character.   If  the  value  equals max, it means that the
       array was too small.

FAR 1.70 beta 4 (build 1282) (13.03.2002)
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

General
~~~~~~~
[!] The full version of FAR, including the build number, is  shown  on  the
    start page of the help system.

[!] For more details read the documentation in PlugDoc.rar::WhatsNew.txt

[+] ArcSupport.txt - configuring archivers for FAR Manager

[!] THE RULES  FOR  HANDLING  SPECIAL  CHARACTER  SEQUENCES  (!.!,  !\  and
    others), that are used, for example, in file associations -  HAVE  BEEN
    CHANGED. NOW FAR DOES NOT PERFORM ANY HANDLING OF QUOTATION MARKS  WHEN
    PROCESSING SUCH SEQUENCES AND DOES NOT ADD ANY QUOTATION MARKS, LIKE IT
    DID IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS. FOR  THE  SYSTEM  TO  WORK  NORMALLY,  IT  IS
    NECESSARY TO REVIEW ALL PLACES WHERE SUCH SEQUENCES ARE USED AND TO ADD
    QUOTES WHERE IT IS NECESSARY (for example, to replace !.! with "!.!").

[!] Because of the changes in file highlighting processing, you  will  have
    to create two new highlighting groups (by default, if no highlighting
    groups are present in the registry, these groups are created
    automatically), to improve the look of some plugin panels:
    a) mask "..", include attribute "[x] Folder" - default colors (that is,
       the color for normal files)
    b) "[ ] Match file mask(s)" - that is,  analysis  only  by  attributes,
       include attribute "[x] Folder" - the color for normal folders.  This
       group must be in the end of the list (preferably the last one).

[!] The registry key for handling policies [HKCU\Software\Far\Policies]  is
    now also handled for the registry branch HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (see
    TechInfo#4 and TechInfo#30 for details).


System
~~~~~~
[*] The default key to detach the FAR console from a non-interactive
    process is Ctrl-Alt-Tab.

[+] New rule (TechInfo#34) allows to specify the set of characters
    that will cause FAR to quote filenames containing those characters.

[+] The environment variable %PATHEXT% can be used in sort groups and
    in the file highlighting specifications.

[-] In FAR 1.70 beta 3, file attributes for an existing Tree.Far were
    not always preserved when the tree was updated.

[-] Changing the sort order from a plugin didn't work correctly.

[!] When deleting a symbolic link pointing to a non-empty directory,
    a redundant warning is no longer shown.

[*] If the user clicks the left mouse button outside a dialog:
      - clicking the left mouse button is handled as pressing Esc;
      - clicking the right mouse button is handled as pressing Enter;
      - other mouse buttons do not have any effect.

[*] Now, when entering a directory on a plugin panel fails (for
    example, because a network share is unaccessible), the cursor
    doesn't jump to the top of the panel.

[*] Now, when trying to enter an unaccessible directory in the NTFS
    file system, an error message is shown and the cursor stays at the
    same place. Earlier in this situation the cursor silently jumped
    to the top of the panel.

[!] Changes related to wheel support under Windows 2000 (see
    TechInfo#33 for details). The parameter "MouseWheelDelta" has been
    renamed to "MsWheelDelta" and now specifies the delta for
    scrolling in the panels.

[-] Incorrect initial positioning of elements when showing a history
    list or a combo box in a dialog.

[*] When the option "AutoComplete in input lines" is disabled, you can
    press Ctrl-End to autocomplete a line.

[+] Now the view/edit history can also be invoked from the viewer or
    editor (by pressing Alt-F11).

[!] Pressing Ctrl-F10 in the internal editor or viewer now positions
    the cursor in the panels to the current file without leaving the
    editor/viewer. To restore the old behaviour (position the cursor
    to the current file and quit the editor or viewer), see macros in
    Addons\Macros\CtrlF10.reg.

[*] Now it is possible to use F6 (switch between viewer/editor) in the
    viewer and editor opened from the Find files dialog (Alt-F7).

[*] Now pressing Shift-F10 immediately after FAR start shows the main menu
    for the active panel. Previously, the menu for the left panel was
    always shown.

[*] Now when moving the cursor in the list of found files (Alt-F7) the
    empty lines separating directories are automatically skipped.

[*] Removed unneeded delays when processing the cursor movement in the
    list of found files (Alt-F7) after the search has been completed.

[+] New behaviour for Alt-F9 (changing the window size) - see
    TechInfo#38.

[-] Windows 2000: the file panels were not updated after deleting a
    symbolic link.

[!] The number of history list items for dialog edit boxes has been
    increased to 64. Unused items are deleted from the registry.

[+] Pressing Shift-Del when a dialog edit box history list is open
    deletes the current item if it is not locked.

[+] Pressing Alt-Shift-F9 in the panels:
    - for plugin panels - invokes the settings of the plugin
      controlling the panel;
    - for normal panels - shows the plugins configuration menu (same
      as Options | Plugins configuration).

[+] Added the capability of creating multiple folders at the same time.
    See the help on the "Create folder" command for details.

[-] Files with quotation marks in the middle of the name were not
    handled correctly. For example, when trying to execute
    Shift-F4 "foo".txt Enter
    FAR reported an error.

[+] Pressing F4 in the "Plugins configuration" menu allows to assign
    hotkeys for the items of that menu, allowing to invoke them later
    through keyboard macro commands.

[-] Windows NT: the mouse was getting locked after running some PE
    executables.

[+] Ctrl-Alt-Ins puts the full path to the current file into the
    clipboard.

[*] If a directory is a symbolic link, "< Link >" instead of "<Folder>"
    is shown in the status line.

[*] Additions to the information in TechInfo#10.

[+] New rule (TechInfo#39) allowing to configure the file names
    sorting order for different locales.

[*] Windows 2000: corrected the behaviour of Ctrl-Alt-F - for reparse
    points (symbolic links and mounted drives) the real path to the
    directory is put into the command line.

[-] The commands to insert paths (Ctrl-], Ctrl-[, Ctrl-Shift-] and
    Ctrl-Shift-[) always inserted paths in the OEM codepage.

[!] Now the following key combinations work when the panels are turned off:
    CtrlG,CtrlF,CtrlAltF,Ctrl[,Ctrl],CtrlShift[,CtrlShift]

[+] Extended the set  of  key  combinations  for  inserting  filenames  and
    pathnames in the panels:
    * Ctrl-Alt-[ - insert the network (UNC) path from the left panel
    * Ctrl-Alt-] - insert the network (UNC) path from the right panel
    * Alt-Shift-[ - insert the network (UNC) path from the active panel
    * Alt-Shift-] - insert the network (UNC) path from the passive panel

[+] Keyboard shortcuts for copying the names of the selected files  on  the
    active panel:
    * Alt-Shift-Ins - full names of selected files
    * Ctrl-Alt-Ins - network (UNC) names of selected files

[!] Keyboard shortcuts  working  with  UNC  names  work  according  to  the
    following rules:
    * for network drives - the network (UNC) name of the file object;
    * for local drives - full name of the file with symbolic links expanded

[+] After FAR Manager is started, it sets the following environment
    variables available for child processes:
      %FARLANG% - Current language of the shell
      %FARUSER% - Current user (if the /u parameter is used)

[+] Shift-F1 in any menu, just like F1, invokes the help system (if
    F1 has been assigned as a hotkey, it will not be possible to
    invoke the help).

[+] The key F5 in the highlight group selection menu creates a new
    group having the same properties as the current group.

[+] The keys Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down in the files highlighting group
    list can be used to move groups up and down in the list.

[+] Pressing Shift-Enter in the panels when the cursor is on a
    directory runs the Windows Explorer and shows the contents of that
    directory.

[+] Pressing Shift-Enter in the disk selection menu starts the Windows
    Explorer and shows the contents of the root drive of that disk.

[-] Records in the plugins cache were duplicated if FAR was started
    through a short file name.

[-] The file panel filter (Ctrl-I) now correctly handles files with
    extensions like "*.aaa,bbb,ccc,ddd,eee,fff".

[+] In some situations (find files, file selection, file associations,
    sort groups and files highlighting) it is possible to use exclude
    masks. An exclude mask is one or several file masks that must not
    be matched by the required files. It is separated from the main
    mask with the character '|'. It is possible to use the semicolon
    (';') to separate masks. It is also possible to embed a mask in
    quotes, if, for example, it contains a separator character. File
    masks are checked for correctness now.

[!] Since the procedure for handling file masks has changed, the
    directory with the name ".." is highlighted in the same way as all
    other directories. If you don't like it and want to revert to the
    old behaviour for highlighting "..", you should change the mask
    for folders in the files highlighting settings from "*.*" to
    "*.*|..".

[+] A warning is shown before clearing history lists (of commands,
    viewing, folders and in dialogs).

[-] When FAR was first started, the Gray* key did not work until any of the
    cursor keys was pressed.

[-] In the quick search, the key combination "AltShift-" searched for
    files starting with "-" and not with "_".

[*] The color of the clock can be  specified  separately  for  the  panels,
    viewer and editor.

[!] Filenames from viewers and editors opened from plugins are now appended
    to the common view/edit history (Alt-F11). For example, this applies to
    the view: and edit: commands (the FARCmds plugin). Plugin  authors  can
    control this behaviour (see the plugin development documentation).

[!] Added a  new  command  line  parameter  "/x"  for  disabling  exception
    handling. The TechInfo#17 rule has been modified accordingly.

[+] Pressing the middle mouse button in the panels is treated the  same  as
    pressing Enter.

[+] Updated the dialog for searching files in the panels (Alt-F7).

[+] The following new features have been added to file search in archives:
    1) Viewing the files found in archives by pressing F3 and F4;
    2) Putting the list of archives  containing  the  found  files  to  the
       temporary panel;
    3) Searching in archives in plugin panels with the OPIF_REALNAMES  flag
       set (for example, the temporary panel).

[*] The look of the "tree" has been changed.

[+] FAR now handles the CLS operating system command internally.

[-] After Ctrl-G the last line of output was erased.

[+] New rule TechInfo#40 for specifying the locale used  for  sorting  file
    names.

[-] Long system error messages were truncated.

[*] Names of temporary files and directories are uppercased.

[-] When entering a character by its  code  (Alt  +  keys  on  the  numeric
    keypad), pressing and holding a numeric key was not handled correctly.

[+] Additional policy parameters (TechInfo#4) for disallowing macro command
    creation, ignoring the "/p" command line  parameter  and  the  path  to
    personal plugins.

[*] Mask matching for a specific highlighting group can be turned off.

[*] The Tab key in the main menu (F9) jumps to the  menu  for  the  passive
    panel ("Left" or "Right"), except for the case when  the  menu  of  the
    passive panel is currently active. In the latter case, Tab jumps to the
    menu of the active panel.

[-] After running some programs that hide the cursor and do not restore  it
    after termination (for example, mailview from PlugRing), the cursor was
    not restored correctly.

[+] A new rule TechInfo#41 allowing to change the cursor positioning
    behaviour when a history list for a dialog input line is first opened.

[!] In the menus "Command history" (Alt-F8), "View/edit history"  (Alt-F11)
    and "Folder history" (Alt-F12), the cursor now jumps to the  last  item
    when you try to move it up from the first item, and the opposite.

[+] Hotkeys for digits have been added in the "Folder shortcuts" menu.

[+] Added control keys to the screen grabber:
    Ctrl-Shift-Left/Ctrl-Shift-Right - move with selection by 10
    characters horizontally
    Ctrl-Shift-Up/Ctrl-Shift-Down - move with selection by 5
    characters vertically

[!] Options "System settings|Add plugins' prefixes to path" and "Interface
    settings|Show scrollbar in menus" have been moved to TechInfo rules #42
    and #43, respectively.

[!] The parameter for showing the copying time described in TechInfo#26  is
    now available in the configuration interface: "Interface settings|Show
    copying time information". However, the dialog allows to set  only  two
    modes: always show the information or turn it off altogether.

[+] New option "Panel settings|Do not update panels automatically" allowing
    to control the mechanism for automatically updating the panels when the
    file system changes.

[*] If a plugin panel (for example, MultiArc) was active when FAR was
    closed, then after FAR Manager restart the directory with the host
    file will be correctly restored, and the cursor will be positioned
    to that file.

[!] The behaviour of the middle mouse button is now configurable.
    "Interface settings"|"Middle button equals Enter in panels"

[+] The tree panel (Ctrl+T) has its own keybar.

[-] Incorrect help topics were shown for the tree panel.

[+] New rule TechInfo#45 for restoring the FAR Manager console window
    code page after running external programs (that do not restore the
    old code page value upon completion).

[+] Added an option "Update read only description files" in the "File
    descriptions" configuration dialog.

[+] New rule (TechInfo#46) allowing to save the settings under Windows
    NT (and higher) when the option "System settings | Auto save
    setup" is enabled and the user has clicked the Close button of the
    FAR Manager console window.

[+] A change in the rule TechInfo#25 allowing to configure the cursor
    size in the overtype mode.

[-] Under Windows 9x/Me, after a command "cd //host/share", the panel
    caption looked like "C:\\host\share" (the current drive letter was
    prepended to the UNC path).


Info panel
~~~~~~~~~~
[*] Now it is possible to scroll the description file shown in the
    information panel using the mouse.

[*] Now the information panel has its own keybar.

[-] Incorrect help topic was shown when F1 was pressed in the
    information panel.

[-] When trying to delete the description file currently displayed in
    the information panel, a sharing violation occurred.

[-] Pressing F4 in the information panel when no folder description
    files were specified caused FAR to crash.

[-] Now when pressing F4 in the information panel, if the description
    file does not exist, FAR doesn't take into accout filenames
    containing characters * and ? for determining the name of the
    description file to be created.

[-] The information panel was not updated after changing the Folder
    description files option.

[+] The info panel has its own keybar.


QuickView
~~~~~~~~~
[*] Now the quick view panel has its own keybar.

[-] Incorrect help topic was shown when F1 was pressed in the quick
    view panel.

[-] The Change drive menu invoked from the quick view panel could not
    be closed by pressing Esc.

[*] For mounted drives, it is shown that the drive  is  a  mounted  volume,
    and, if possible, the drive letter is also shown.


File attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[-] Problems with setting the file date/time and the Read-only attribute.

[+] Double-clicking a "Modification", "Creation" or "Last access" label
    sets the respective date and time fields to the current time.
    Double-clicking a date/time edit field sets the respective date or
    time component to the current value.

[+] F4 in the tree panel also invokes the attributes dialog.

[!] Changes to TechInfo#15 for better compatibility with FAR 1.6x.

[-] It was not possible to set  the  Encrypted  attribute  for  files  with
    Cyrillic characters.


Copy/Move
~~~~~~~~~
[-] When calculating the copy time, the time when dialogs are shown is
    not included in the total time.

[*] When moving files or directories within the current drive, the
    total size is not calculated when the option "[x] Show total copy
    progress indicator" is enabled.

[+] Windows 2000: creating symbolic links for directories (Alt-F6),
    also available in the directory tree panel.

[+] Multicopy. It is possible to specify multiple filenames separated
    with semicolons (';') in the destination edit box. For example:
    "c:\foo\;d:\foo2".

[-] Problems with creating symbolic links under Windows 2000.

[-] Recursive copying of linked directories (copying onto itself).

[+] Shift-F10 allows to show the directory tree for the  drive  entered  in
    the input line.

[+] Windows NT/2000: for file objects with multiple streams (if the option
    "Use  system  copy  routine"  is  turned  off),  a  warning  about  the
    possibility of losing additional streams is shown, The same warning  is
    shown when trying to copy such files to a volume that  doesn't  support
    multiple streams.

[-] Windows 2000/XP/NTFS5: when copying or moving an encrypted folder to a
    file system that does not support encryption, the capabilities of the
    destination file system were not taken into account.


File associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[-] The association "!@AFQ!" in the root of any drive created a list
    in which filenames had two backslashes in a row, for example,
    "E:\\file.txt".

[-] In associations with IF EXIST, the @ character was not handled
    correctly.

[-] In associations with IF EXIST, quotes in the middle of a filename
    (for example, C:\1\"test 2.ttt") were not handled correctly.

[+] New special sequences that are expanded to file extensions:
     "!`" - long extension of the file;
     "!`~" - short extension of the file.
    For example, for the file "foo.ext" the special sequence "!`" will be
    expanded to ".ext".

[+] It is possible to specify commands for the alternate  viewer  (Alt-F3),
    alternate editor  (Alt-F4)  and  Ctrl-PgDn  in  the  file  associations
    dialog.

[*] The help topic has been broken into 3 parts:
     1. "File associations"
        Introduction. General information.
     2. "Editing file associations"
        For the file associations editing dialog.
     3. "Special symbols"
        Description of supported special symbols.
     Consequently,  the  file  association  selection  menu  and  the  file
     associations editing dialog now have separate help topics.


Editor
~~~~~~
[-] Incorrect description for Shift-Enter in the help file.

[+] Ctrl-Shift-Enter - insert the full name of the file being edited.

[-] Entering a character code (Ctrl-Q) did not mark the text as
    modified.

[-] Entering a character code (Ctrl-Q) did not put data into the undo
    buffer.

[-] XLat translation did not put data into the undo buffer.

[-] When a block was pasted and the autoindent was enabled, spaces
    instead of tabs were inserted in the beginning of each line.

[!] By default, files with the Read-Only attribute are not locked and
    the warning is not shown (restored the behaviour of FAR 1.65).

[+] Two options from TechInfo (#19) have been added to the editor
    options dialog:
     - Disable editing of files with the R/O attribute
     - Warn when opening files with the R/O attribute

[+] New behaviour for opening a file already opened for editing. Three
    choices are available - "Show current", "Reload" and "New
    instance". Also an option has been added to the confirmation
    dialog to control the behaviour of opening an already opened but
    unchanged file (see the help file for details).

[-] It was possible to indent or unindent (Alt-I/Alt-U) stream blocks
    when the editor was locked (Ctrl-L).

[-] Fixed a problem causing a change in the look of the cursor in the
    editor and input lines after running some DOS tasks. Such cursor
    looked like it was positioned one line higher than it actually
    was.

[-] In the character table selection menu (Shift-F8),  the  item  with  the
    table detected when the file was  opened  was  selected,  even  if  the
    current table was different.

[+] New option "Persistent blocks in edit controls".

[-] A non-persistent block was not deselected when the user clicked a mouse
    button.

[-] Ctrl-], Ctrl-[, Ctrl-Shift-]  Ctrl-Shift-[ always inserted strings  in
    the OEM codepage.

[*] The default size of the editor undo buffer has been increased from
    64 to 2048 elementary operations.

[+] It is possible to change the undo buffer size (see TechInfo#44).


Viewer
~~~~~~
[-] Now when scrolling with the scrollbar in the internal viewer,
    lines are not "torn" (the viewer is always positioned on a
    line boundary).

[-] Sometimes after opening the viewer in the Windows codepage
    the keybar title for the F8 button showed Win instead of DOS.

[*] +/- now work in the viewer after switching to the editor by pressing
    F6 and then switching back.

[-] The current position was set incorrectly after clicking the viewer
    scrollbar in very large files.

[!] Because D is a hexadecimal digit, it is no longer allowed to
    use D in the Goto dialog to specify a decimal offset.

[+] Ctrl-Ins copies the selection (search results) to the clipboard.


Help
~~~~
[-] Fixed a bug with pressing F5 in a help file opened from HLFViewer.

[*] The Tab character in help files is converted to spaces.  The  tab  size
    can be specified with the option ".Options TabSize=<size>". The default
    tab size is 8.

[+] The plugins help list (Shift-F2) is now alphabetically sorted.

[*] Clicking the middle mouse button is treated as pressing Enter.

[+] A double-click in the non-scrolling area of a help window zooms
    the window, as if F5 had been pressed.

User menu
~~~~~~~~~
[+] Added handling for the remark statements "rem" and "::" located at the
    beginning of a line.

[-] The submenu pointer alignment did not work correctly.

[*] Macros are expanded in submenu headers.

[+] Cursor keys Left/Right open and close submenus.

[*] After a user menu command has been executed, the previous contents
    of the command line is restored.


Macros
~~~~~~
[!] The information on macro commands (TechInfo#22) has  been  moved  to  a
    separate document "Macros[.Rus].txt"

[!] Added a workaround for a bug in the Win9X Conagent.exe -  pressing  the
    Left key on the numeric keypad with  NumLock  turned  on  inserted  the
    following sequence into the keyboard buffer:  Left  Down,  Shift  Down,
    Shift Up, Left Up. This made it impossible to assign a macro command to
    the Left key.

[+] New macro command attribute "Selection present".

[!] New dialog for configuring additional macro command settings.

[+] New help topic for the additional macro settings dialog.

[+] Two new pseudo-keys "MsWheelUp" and "MsWheelDown".

[-] Macros for the keys Alt-Shift-<digit> did not work in the panels.

[-] Macros created for the "Tree" area were saved in the "Info" area.

[!] Macro keys "$Year", "$Month", "$Day", "$Hour", "$Min" and "$Sec" are no
    longer supported and  have  been  replaced  with  a  single  macro  key
    "$Date".
